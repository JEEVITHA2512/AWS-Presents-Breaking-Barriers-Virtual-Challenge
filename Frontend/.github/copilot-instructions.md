This project is a React-based product webpage for Nephele, featuring a sticky navigation bar, hero section, about, features, video showcase, and footer. Use standard CSS or styled-components (no Tailwind). Prepare for AWS Amplify and S3 integration. All components should be responsive and support smooth scrolling.
